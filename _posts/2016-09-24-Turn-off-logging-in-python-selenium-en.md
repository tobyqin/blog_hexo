Python selenium will print a lot of debug info for selenium driver, which will mess up important information for your testing.

To turn it off, please add bellow code before test case.

```python
from selenium.webdriver.remote.remote_connection import LOGGER
LOGGER.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```
**Note:** above code should be put before webdriver initialization.
